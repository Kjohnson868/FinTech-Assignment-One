## Overview & Origin
Wealthsimple provides algorithmic investment and savings programs for clients in Canada, the U.K., and the United States. New clients can transfer taxable and retirement accounts or deposit funds into new accounts. The account minimum is $0, making it easy for new investors to get started. A small pool of low-fee ETFs (for Canadians and U.S. citizens) or mutual funds (for U.K. citizens) is used to populate relatively generic portfolios that are further customized by the information you put into the platform. 
It was incorporated in September 2014 by Michael Katchen but the true story actually starts in 2012 when Ancestry.com bought 1000Memories. At that time Katchen developed a spreadsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios. Interest in the spreadsheet helped inspire the idea for Wealthsimple. In 2014, he returned to Toronto to launch the company.
Wealthsimple has raised a total of $900.4M in funding over 9 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on May 3, 2021 from a Private Equity round.
Wealthsimple is primarily owned by Power Corporation of Canada, under the subsidiary Power Financial. The nearly 100-year-old international management and holding company has over $470 billion in assets, as well as Power Financial, IGM and Pargesa, focusing on insurance, retirement, wealth management and investment businesses, including a portfolio of alternative asset investment platforms. Described as a “Canadian financial giant,” Power Financial also has majority stakes in Great-West Lifeco and Portag3.
## Business Activities
Wealthsimple Trade is Canada's only commission-free trading platform. So you can buy and sell thousands of stocks, without extra fees. You can use it to build your own passive investing portfolio of ETFs, like the ones we make, or just to buy shares in companies you believe in.
In Canada, Wealthsimple offers a full range of accounts, including tax-free savings accounts (TFSA), corporate accounts, joint accounts, retirement savings plans (RSP), locked-in retirement accounts (LIRA), registered retirement income funds (RRIF), registered education savings plans (RESP) and taxable accounts.
In the United Kingdom, Wealthsimple offers pension accounts, individual savings accounts (ISA), junior individual savings accounts (JISA) and personal taxable accounts.
Traditional investment companies typically target a demographic of people aged 45 and above, but Weathsimple’s CEO, Katchen, wants to bring people into the world of investment earlier. >Millennials are missing out on opportunities to secure their financial future,<> he explained. >A lot of young people are mistrustful of big banks and put off by the paperwork. We are combining financial expertise with smart IT to shake up the industry and modernise investment.<>
By using technology to automate the investment process, Wealthsimple keeps costs low for its customers and provides them with a simple mobile app for managing their portfolio.
Wealthsimple caters to the uninitiated millennial investor, with a reported 80% of its clients under the age of 45, and 40% of them being first-time investors. About a quarter of its clients are socially responsible investors, meaning they have money invested in Wealthsimple’s SRI portfolios, which support companies that prioritize environmental and social concerns and have a positive record on human rights and corruption.

## Landscape

* Movement from investment bankers to artificial intellgience
* Adoption of machine learning. One use of machine learning is helping executives and banking teams qucikly analyse large streams of data to make better decisions.

For financial services firms, predictive analystics helps assess risk and forecasting market movements. For isntance, a predictive engine could look at a potential deal, analyze multiple variables, and create a risk score that helpsyou decide if it's worth an investment.
* NAtural language processing (NLO) is a branch of AI that seeks to help machines understand human language. NLP engines can examine emails, documents, and even spoken words to spot issue, uncover fraud, identify unusual transactions, or draw conclusions, which translates to saving thousands of person-hours per year.
* Virtual data rooms - A virtual data room, or a VDR is an online database in which companies can store and share confidential information, usually used during a financial transaction.  VDRs are also used as ongoing document repositories, allowing businesses to organize critical business documents for easy, secure access.
* Blockchain: Made famous by cryptocurrencies, blockchain is a decentralized database where data is stored in blocks chained together.

## Results
Wealthsimple has changed investing. They've been able to penetrate the millenial unsophisticated investor segment. Additionally  investors who want to keep money saved away, but want to earn more interest than a typical savings account can use their lowest risk porfilio. Wealthsimple shines the most in its diverse portfolio choices that include speciality porfolio offerings adn its unlimited access to certfiied financial planners no matter your account type. Their extreme transparency concerning management fees is a value add for their client base who value genuine connections and up front disclosure of costing.
Traditionally Robo-advisors & investment management companies have been assessed based on their ability to manage the quality and risk of cash flow by bringing assets in-house, keeping the number of clients down and the average asset size up. Wealthsimple has over 2 million users on their platform and therefore has changed the metrics to include user count and build out their internal ecosystem. This has inturn paid off big for Wealthsimple. A 2021 valuation of Wealth simple put it at $5 Billion. This is 52% AUM as compared to the usual industry average of 2-5% of AUM.

## Recommendations
One of the major drawbacks of Wealthsimple is its management fee on accounts under $100k which is the majority of their accounts. Their fee is higher than many other robo advisoers including betterment and Wealthfront. Wealthsimple does offer a great value for accounts with higher deposit at a compeititive management fee. In light of that the platform is primarily recommended for those who have either a) at least $100k to invest, b) those that don't midn paying a little extra for the seamlessness of automation and c) those that don't require human interaction. Conversely this limitation gives rise to a great opportunity to service a set of investors who have less than 100K but don't want to pay high fees. This market size is estimated to be at least 25 million customers, 25%% of Wealthsimple's current users. Though Wealthsimple product portfolio has traditionally centered around Robo-advisers for those that are under 100K and high fees OR lower fees and portfolio managers for those over $100k. A recommendaiton is for Wealthsimple to create a light or sample package that 25 million users segment. The product would be a 1 year trial of the service with 2 investor check-ins per month & 50% off the monthly fees. This will give hesistant adopters of the Wealthsimple platform a sufficient reason to utilize it.
